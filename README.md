Just a curiousity. 

This is R code to pre-tabulate second-alignment early votes for all possible first-alignment candidate viability scenarios in a precinct, given a set of ranked-choice votes.

I was just curious how easy the problem described here (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nevada-democrats-canceled-their-caucus-app-but-that-poses-its-own-problems/) would be to solve without using an app.

Early votes for the first round can be easily tabulated beforehand. This code accomplishes the precalculation of the second-round votes from early voters.  These results could be printed on paper to be 100% analogue at the precinct-level. Using classification tables as an index would allow the precinct chair to easily find their specific viability scenario from the long list of tables.
